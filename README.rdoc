= rbfunge

Rbfunge is a Befunge-93 interpreter for Ruby (although I may implement Befunge-98 support later).
Right now it's not so perfect, but I'll keep working on it.

== Usage

To installl rbfunge:

	% gem install rbfunge
	
Once rbfunge is installed, you can use it to interpret your Befunge-93 code.

Load a file via the command line:

	% rbfunge test.bf

== History

* 0.1.0 - Initial release.  Pretty unstable.
